# Stochastic Processes Course - Final Project
A stochastic process is a collection of random variables indexed by time or space. It represents systems or phenomena that evolve in a way that is at least partly random. Stochastic processes are essential in modeling uncertainty in various fields, including physics, finance, biology, and economics. In the other hand Economic physics, also known as econophysics, applies theories and methods from physics, particularly statistical mechanics and stochastic processes, to analyze economic systems. The goal is to understand economic phenomena using the rigorous mathematical framework and empirical methods developed in physics.

In this project we want to see what stochastic processes have to say in econophysics.
