# Stochastic Processes Course - HW01
In this exercise, we want to generate datasets with the number of data 10^2, 10^3, 10^4, 10^5 and 10^6 with normal distribution (mean 0 and variance 1) and uniform (0 to 1). Then we
want to draw their histogram with a special interval according to the number of data and
then determine the shape of the probability distribution function. After that, we specify
the error for each interval and draw the error bar of each interval in the graph.
