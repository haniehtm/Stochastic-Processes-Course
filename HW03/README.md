# Stochastic Processes Course - HW03
In this exercise, we want to check the second-order stationarity of a data. We have used
two data, one is normal data generated by ourselves and the other is Autoregressive data.
To check the second-order stationary, for first method we must first separate the data into
windows of length L, where L is from 3(because variance can be obtained from 3 numbers
of data) to 1/5 of number of data and obtain the variance of each window, then take the
average of the variance of windows. Then draw the plot of average variances according to
L. If this graph converges towards a number, then we can say that this data is second-order
stationary(because we have used variance) and the length of the second-order stationary is
the point where the plot starts to converge.

The second method is to check the second-order stationarity of the data at different levels
of confidence through p-value.
