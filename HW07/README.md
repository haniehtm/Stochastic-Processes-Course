# Stochastic Processes Course - HW07
In the study of stochastic processes, understanding the underlying dynamics of systems
influenced by random forces is of paramount importance. One powerful method to analyze
such systems is through the Kramers-Moyal (KM) expansion, which provides a way to
describe the evolution of the probability distribution of a stochastic variable. In this exercise
we want to estimate KM coefficient with moments.
