# Stochastic Processes Course - HW06
In the study of stochastic processes, understanding the underlying dynamics of systems
influenced by random forces is of paramount importance. One powerful method to analyze
such systems is through the Kramers-Moyal (KM) expansion, which provides a way to
describe the evolution of the probability distribution of a stochastic variable. When dealing
with two-dimensional systems, where two interdependent variables evolve over time, the two-dimensional Kramers-Moyal coefficient becomes a crucial tool for uncovering the intricate
details of the stochastic dynamics.
The primary challenge in analyzing two-dimensional stochastic processes lies in accurately
characterizing the joint dynamics of the two variables involved. Consider two time series,
X1(t) and X2(t), which represent the evolution of two interdependent stochastic variables
over time.
The goal is to derive the two-dimensional Kramers-Moyal coefficients from these time series.
By accurately estimating these coefficients, we can develop a deeper understanding of
the systemâ€™s behavior, enabling better predictions and control. This analysis is particularly
useful in fields where noise plays a significant role.
