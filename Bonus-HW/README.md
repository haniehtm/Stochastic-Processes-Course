# Stochastic Processes Course - Bonus HW
In this exercise, We simulate 10 Ode equation of order 1 with Gaussian white noise of mean
0 and variance 0.5. From the 10 time series we have, we calculate the high-order interactions
and find the correlation coefficients by calculating the Kramers-Moyal coefficients. We use
the Hints library method here, with the difference that in this library, the variance value is
fixed at 0.1. Therefore, we re-simulate all the internal codes of this package for a variance
of 0.5.
