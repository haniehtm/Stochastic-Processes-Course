# Stochastic Processes Course - HW02
In this exercise, we want to first draw the graphs of (X)*P(X), (X^2)*P(X), (X^3)*P(X),... in terms of X for an arbitrary number of data and bins and check their behavior for different data. The reason for this is to see that for any number of data it is reasonable to calculate up to the which highest order. Then, in the second part of the exercise, we go to the moments,
and draw the graph of different moments in terms of the number of data and check them.
